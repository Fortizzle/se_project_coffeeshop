# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

To improve the navigation on the site, I would suggest adding a floating nav bar to make page navigation easier on any page.

Adding functioning social links would also be smart.
